I am a third-year master's student from the [School of Mathematics](https://math.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). My primary research interests are in 3D computer vision, multimodal large models, AIGC, embodied intelligence, topological data analysis and machine learning. 

I believe that deep learning models can leverage multimodal information‚Äîsuch as text, images, point clouds, and topology‚Äîto understand 3D spatial information, thereby enhancing the models' capabilities for "**DiscriminationüëÅ**," "**Imaginationü§î**," and "**Creationü§ñ**."

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liu](https://math.seu.edu.cn/lqs_2339_en/list.htm) at the Key Laboratory of Collective Intelligence of Cyberspace, Jiangsu Province.

Point cloud is complex 3D data characterized by its irregularity and unordered structure. In contrast to previous efforts aimed at extracting local geometric information by sophisticated techniques, which have reached a saturation point in efficacy, we delve into the rich topological information of point clouds using persistent homology. First, we introduce two novel vectorization methods, PPDTF and PDTF, to transform topological information into a format suitable for deep neural networks. Then we propose TopoLayer, a simple but effective and universal neural network layer seamlessly integrated into existing architectures. Integration of TopoLayer, without architectural modifications, significantly improves established models such as PointMLP and PointNet++. For classification on ModelNet40, the class mean accuracy of PointMLP notably improves from 91.3\% to 91.8\%, surpassing the state-of-the-art PointMixer. Additionally, PointNet++ achieves a remarkable gain of 2.7\%. For part segmentation on ShapeNetPart, PointMLP achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with 85.1\% Cls.mIoU, while PointNet++ secures a significant 0.9\% increase. Moreover, TopoLayer also demonstrates its effectiveness in the case of loss of geometric information.

DiT-3D, a pioneer of diffusion transformer architecture for 3D shape generation, has demonstrated significant performance. However, the voxel-based operations of DiT-3D induce redundant and information-less tokens while reducing training efficiency. Additionally, DiT-3D is unable to extract and integrate global topological information for feature learning. To address these limitations, we propose TopoDiT-3D, an innovative Topology-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture with a bottleneck structure for 3D shape generation. Specifically, we design the bottleneck structure utilizing Perceiver Resampler, which not only adaptively filters out redundant patch tokens to improve training efficiency, but also offers a mode to integrate topological information extracted through persistent homology into feature learning. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the DiT-3D model in both effectiveness and training efficiency on the ShapeNet dataset. For the airplane category, our TopoDiT-3D reduces the 1-Nearest Neighbor Accuracy of the state-of-the-art method by 9.17 and increases the Coverage metric by 11.54 when using the Chamfer Distance. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of the bottleneck structure in diffusion transformers and the significance of luxuriant topological information for 3D shape generation, rather than only focusing on local information.

TopoDDPM is divided into two phases, the first stage is to use topological features as shape latent variables to establish a probabilistic diffusion model for point cloud generation. The second stage is to establish a probabilistic diffusion model for topological feature generation.
