## About Me
I am a third-year master's student from the [School of Mathematics](https://math.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). My primary research interests are in 3D computer vision, multimodal large models, AIGC, Embodied intelligence, topological data analysis and machine learning. 

I believe that deep learning models can leverage multimodal information—such as text, images, point clouds, and topology—to understand 3D spatial information, thereby enhancing the models' capabilities for "**discrimination👁**," "**imagination🤔**," and "**creation🤖**."

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liu](https://math.seu.edu.cn/lqs_2339_en/list.html) at the Key Laboratory of Collective Intelligence of Cyberspace, Jiangsu Province.
